Museum Explorer

This project is a simple web app that shows artworks from The Metropolitan Museum of Art collection.
API Used

I used The Met's public API to get data about artworks. The API provides details about thousands of objects in their collection.

API Docs: [Metropolitan Museum API](https://metmuseum.github.io/)

How I Accessed the Data

I accessed the API using React and TypeScript. First, I made a request to search for artworks (e.g., paintings, sculptures). Then, I used the artwork IDs to get more details about each object, like its image, title, and artist.

Here's the basic code to get started:
